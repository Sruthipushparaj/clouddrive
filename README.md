## Azure Services

1. Resource Group: A resource group is a logical container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. It helps manage and organize resources, such as web apps, databases, or storage accounts, as a single entity.

2. Web App: An Azure Web App is a cloud service that enables you to build and host web applications in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. It provides automatic scaling, high availability, and easy integration with other Azure services.

3. Storage Account: Azure Storage is Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data, enabling you to store and access files, blobs, queues, tables, and disks.

4. Container: In the context of Azure Storage, a container is a unit of organization within a storage account. Containers hold blobs, files, or tables and are used to manage access and lifecycle policies for the stored data.

5. Monitoring: Azure provides monitoring solutions for tracking the performance, availability, and usage of your applications and resources. Azure Monitor is a platform service that collects and analyzes telemetry data from various Azure resources, allowing you to gain insights and take actions to optimize your applications.
